    <h1>Astrology is Interesting</h1>
    <p>I enjoy learning more about astrology. There are different <strong>planets</strong> that can be in different <strong> signs</strong> For example, I am a Scorpio sun, Aries moon, and Saggitarius rising. You can learn your own signs and more about astrology on <a href = "https://astro.cafeastrology.com/" >CafeAstrology</a></p>
